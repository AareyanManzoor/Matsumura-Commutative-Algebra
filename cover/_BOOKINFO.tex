{This book, based on the author's lectures at Brandeis University in 1967 and
1968, is designed for use as a textbook on commutative algebra by students of
modern algebraic geometry or abstract algebra.\\
Part I is devoted to basic concepts such as dimension, depth, normal rings, and
regular local rings; Part II deals with the finer structure theory of noetherian
rings initiated by Zariski and developed by Nagata and Grothendieck.\\
In this second edition, the chapter on Depth has been completely rewritten.
There is also a new Appendix consisting of several sections, which are almost
independent of each other. The Appendix has two purposes: to prove the 
theorems used but not proved in the text; to record same of the recent
achievements in the areas connected with Part II.\\
For specialists in commutative algebra, this book will serve as an introduction
to the more difficult and detailed books of Nagata and Grothendieck.
To geometers, it will be a convenient handbook of algebra.
