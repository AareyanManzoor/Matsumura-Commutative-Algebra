Here is a link to a dyslexic friendly version: \url{https://aareyanmanzoor.github.io/assets/matsumura-CA-dyslexic.pdf}

We changed some notation. Maps between spec was changed from $^a\phi$ to $\SpecInduced{\phi}$. $I$-adic completion was changed from $A^\ast$ to $\completion{A}$.

Some comments by editors were made in footnotes.

We added a bibliography, the original book cited references in the text without having a dedicated bibliography.

We added citations and references with hyperlinks. References to e.g. theorems/paragraphs in the book are in blue, while citations to the bibliography is in red. The bibliography also has URLs now, for easy access. Some of the books in the bibliography  had newer editions, so we went with those.
