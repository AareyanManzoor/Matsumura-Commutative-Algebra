\begin{enumerate}[label = \arabic*.]
    \item All rings and algebras are tacitly assumed to be commutative with unit element.
    \item If $F:A\varrightarrow{} B$ is a homomorphism of rings and if $I$ is an ideal of $B$, then the ideal $f^{-1}(I)$ is denoted by $I\cap A$
    \item $\subset$ means proper inclusion
    \item We sometimes use the old-fashioned notation $I = (a_1, \dots , a_n)$ for an ideal $I$ generated by the elements $a_j$.
    \item By a finite $A$-module we mean a finitely generated $A$-module. By a finite $A$-algebra, we mean an algebra which is a finite $A$-module. By an $A$-algebra of finite type, we mean an algebra which is finitely generated as a ring over the canonical image of $A$.
